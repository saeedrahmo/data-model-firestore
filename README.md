The workload data contains the workload generated from two industrial benchmarks NDBench from Netflix and Dell DVD store from Dell. Both benchmarks are deployed on a cluster of cloud VMs on AWS and Azure clouds. The workload has been split to training sets and testing sets for machine learning purpose.<br />

In each of the workload file, the first 4 columns contain the following attributes.<br />
